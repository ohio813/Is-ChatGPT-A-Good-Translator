Especially in surgical interventions with a high perioperative risk of complications, these findings can be incorporated into a goal-directed therapy.
Corresponding algorithms for enhanced hemodynamic monitoring and volume management already exist in many areas, but they are often not consistently implemented in the processes of their own clinic.
In this article, we demonstrate the utility and relevance of TTE hemodynamic evaluation at every stage of patient care.
According to 45 (67%) repliers, a mandatory examination exists.
There are no consistent regulations regarding vision screening in the Canton of St. Gallen.
A standardization of the applied screening procedures at cantonal and national levels seems reasonable.
In 5.2% of cases an inpatient rehabilitation had been done before, but there was no indication for a renewal.
CONCLUSION
METHODS
Data were assessed prospectively in 2015 over 9 months, in total 916 admissions were assessed.
Ophthalmic examin ation (including tear film break-up time [TFBUT] and meibometry) was undertaken on three groups (pugs with and without ophthalmologic abnormalities as well as on other brachycephalic breeds with history of ophthalmologic abnormalities).
These important research resources enable a comprehensive research approach by integrating clinical, environmental, genomic, and molecular information.
Antiviral treatment options include topical ganciclovir or systemic valganciclovir.
Median follow-up time after initiation of ganciclovir medication was 26 (range 4 to 62) months. Median number of episodes under treatment was 1 (range 0 - 6), corresponding to a mean of 0.19 episodes per year (p = 0.04, 2-sided paired t-test).
Although a rare entity in Central Europe, the important feature of CMV uveitis is its hypertensive and recurrent nature.
The prevalence of adolescents with pathological Internet use was 3.71 % in the follow-up survey. Furthermore, 20.48 % of adolescents reported sleep problems.
Pathological and excessive Internet use were predictors of sleep problems over the course of one year.
An interdisciplinary approach involving a forensic pathologist and a paediatric haemostaseologist for assessment of bleeding symptoms, the explanation of the clinical findings, and the critical evaluation of laboratory results are essential in such cases.
There were no significant differences between medical and nursing staff.
He was previously evaluated for similar set of symptoms over the past eight years.
The aim of this article is to show that important conclusions can be drawn in the everyday practice as to which symptoms need to be clarified how and how urgently, and which belong in the hands of a specialized sleep center.
This study aimed at evaluating statistical correlations between trunk muscle strength and kinetic parameters during judo-specific pulling movements in judo players.
Twenty-one male sub-elite judo players aged 22 ± 4 years with a mean training volume of 15 ± 4 hours per week participated in this study.
25 of 30 (83.3 %) liveborn children with an intention to treat were alive at the latest follow-up.
56.0 % of infants underwent staged repair, 44.0 % had one-stage complete repair.
The mean value for pain before intervention was 8.8 in the RFS group and 8.7 in the CSP group.
On the second postoperative day, there was a significant pain reduction with a value of 2.4 for both groups, which remained more or less constant over the follow-up period.
A profit can be generated with both techniques.
This narrative review gives a broad summary of the psychosocial strain in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and psychotherapeutic interventions addressing these issues.
Future research could aim to adapt therapy programs that already have been proven to be effective in other populations with advanced diseases.
The mortality rate of Swiss IBD patients is comparable with the one of patients without IBD.
RESULTS
Patients with ALD show a significant correlation between CYP2E1, the occurrence of highly carcinogenic etheno DNA adducts and the severity of fibrosis.
A recent survey among plastic surgery residents and directors of microsurgical clinics demonstrates a great interest in high- quality microsurgery education.
Unfortunately, due to economic pressures, limited operating resources as well as forensic considerations, it has become a challenge to provide sufficient on-the-job training, which needs to be shifted outside of the OR.
RESULTS
Visualising the uterus proved impossible in two of four skinny rabbits (2.8 %), whereas in all 39 obese rabbits the uterus was visible.
The following ear deformities were treated: cup ear, lop ear, steel ear, helical rim abnormalities, antihelical rim abnormalities.
In addition, the following parameters were evaluated: time of application, complications, satisfaction of parents, cost comparison between the EarWell™ system and otoplasty.
CONCLUSION
Another advantage is the low costs compared with the costs of otoplasty.
However, due to ever-decreasing sizes of incisions and trocars, injection and removal of highly viscous silicone oils is very time-consuming.
Besides minimally invasive surgical techniques, there are a number of anaesthesiological aspects like the choice of short acting anaesthetics, the use of regional analgesia, a balanced intraoperative fluid therapy, the avoidance of postoperative nausea and vomiting and, most importantly, protective ventilation, that need to be considered.
In patients undergoing thoracic surgery procedures with preexisting severe limitations in pulmonary function, protective ventilation under the conditions of one lung ventilation often leads to severe dysfunction of pulmonary gas exchange.
An inverted uterus is defined as the eversion of the uterus into the vagina.
This can lead to hypovolemic shock and circulatory failure.
Therapy includes urgent uterine repositioning under narcosis and curettage after manual abruption of the placenta.
Often psychiatric symptoms/comorbidities increase the probability of a complicated course of the disease with a reciprocal interaction of gut complaints and psychiatric symptoms.
The experiences and perspectives of experts from different healthcare sectors were explored within 39 semi-structured individual interviews.
Nevertheless, there are indications that justify artificial hydration and others that rather forbid it.
