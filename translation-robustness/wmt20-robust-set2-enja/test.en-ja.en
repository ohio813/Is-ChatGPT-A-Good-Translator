Hey i really know what it feels like to hate yourself.
It took me 25 years to realize that i did too.
I've put a lot of pressure on myself just like you.
For myself, i had trouble talking to anybody in my family or even most of my friends and i lost my girlfriend to this but after seeing a few professionals it felt like most of them weren't really of any use.
I've had a long talk with one of my long time friend and she was able to help me because she told me that i didn't have to put so much pressure on myself.
Actually accepting the fact that i hated myself made me realize that i was trying to push people away because i didn't deserve to be loved.
It helped me starting to accpet myself.
I am at the begining of that journey but i now allow myself to be happy and i try to take care of myself by doing stuff i enjoy, one small step at a time.
If you want to, please feel free to hsare anything that is on your mind.
Myself and other will do our best to try to understand and help you.
I love you, please allow yourself to love you too.
i wouldn't give up, maybe just ask support at plarium to see if they can help?

Yeah I think hes a buy low guy in deeper leagues if hes on the wire.
14-20 teamers I'm grabbing him for sure.
A friend of mine used to have a fairly significant number of lows for a long time - most likely for \_years\_ - before he got a G6.
(He was relying exclusively on fingerstick tests before.)
He reached a point where he hardly felt hypos anymore.
But after greatly improving his BG control with the G6 (specifically, reducing the number and severity of hypos), he noticed that he started to feel them better again.
So, there's a good chance it will come back.
Just started doing melee Vorkath (99 att/str, 92 def) with dragon lance.
I was wondering if it was better to do Vorkath with serpentine helm or neitzot helm.
If it was someone I already had to warn/ban before and hes going around randomly sneekily making insulting personal comments about me?
yeah I would lol Id ban them for doing the same to you also, its just toxic shit that helps ruin a community, especially a relativly small one.

Of all those stats, class rank is probably the only one you can sorta judge by.
Valedictorians with 1600s get turned down if it looks like they‚Äôre just checking boxes.

"So Urianger, I stopped by the solar at the Waking Sands for the first time in ages, only to find the entire room plastered in... Boudoir pinup posters of F'lhaminn.
Any idea how that happened?"
"'Twas a horror most foul, trepidaciously observed by mine eye and mine eye alone.
As I reflected upon the plight of the star in facing its oldest and most mortal enemy, those Paragons of the lost Primal, woe betide me but to be unexpectedly chanced on by their herald in the flesh!
His baleful gaze astrode the room with sinister intent and I grasped his cruel intention only as it took hold in the corporeal.
Creation magicks the like of which hath never been witnessed since the Sundering arose of his tempered will, and flowed across our sanctum.
You see, the Ascian rightfully ascertained that to warp and break The Scions would require a rift of disdain to spread 'cross its wisest members, turning them 'gainst each other.
Thus did he seek to disparage my midst impeccable standing amongst my peers by belittling me in the most petty way, a way that would forever change the way I am viewed.
The only recourse against this odious plot is to deign it no attention or thought.
By forgetting the vile scheme we may negate it and thus waste the Ascians' foremost magicks."

I went to college with a guy who was not much taller than you, pudgy, and (most importantly) has a teeny tiny little peeny.
And EVERYONE knew.
Know why everyone knew?
Because he slept with goddamn every girl I knew.
The guy had more notches in his bedpost than I can count, and has now has had a girlfriend for several years and will most likely marry her.
Being a friendly, confident person that people like to talk to can go a long way.
So can dressing smart, grooming, taking care of yourself physically, ect.
A lot of people coast on their looks but that only gets them so far.
Eventually people will figure out who they are and stop fucking them.

You did something that's so unbearably hard and painful that millions of women are not able to do it for themselves.
Not only have you saved yourself, you're setting a wonderful example for the rest of us.
You have such a good head on your shoulders.
The way you describe your emotions and theories about them shows you have an incredible understanding of pain, and understanding pain is a huge part of not letting it evolve into *suffering*.
My heart is with you as you experience those little and big things that feel like gut punches.
In my own experience (everyone is different), those gut punches happened as the new reality sunk in, and once it wasn't 'new' anymore the thoughts no longer came with physical reactions.
I used to hate hearing 'time heals all wounds' until I acquired wounds that only time could heal.
*Time* doesn't have to be a *long time*, either.
Sometimes it's a paper cut that needs a few minutes for the nerves to chill out, and feels tender for a while after.
Look at all the people that read/upvoted/commented.
You've just given all of us a story of strength and bravery to remember when we feel weak and afraid.
You're a heroine in your story, and we are all so proud of you, and we are all rooting for you.
Your family clearly recognizes the preciousness of your life (explains where you get it from!)
and I'm so glad you have them.
I love you lady stranger, I really do.
I'm so glad the world has you in it.
As another comment pointed out, the Bobs lack the biological feedback elements that are usually associated with a desire for sexual activity.
Much like the self-reinforcing panic/emotional things focused on in mid-book 1, the sexual feedback components may have simply been left out.
Bear in mind, functionally speaking, the Bobs are immortal, capable of asexual replication, and lack any physical or biological ability or need to engage in sexual activity.
Also, without the imperative to populate or continue the species via a cooperative activity, sex was likely a low priority.
In light of the Others, hunting the other factions, transplanting humanity, etc.
I'm sure sex was the last item on the list.
I would be very interested to see a psychological study done on this sort of hypothetical existence.
In the absence of a biological imperative to mate for procreation, would recreational sexual activity be present or prioritized?
Lastly, not to go down a rabbit hole here, but given the effectively "ethereal" nature of the Bobs (sort of post-human or post-singularity), there is no reason a Bob could not have either come into existence (for lack of a better term) as female, or delved into a quasi-transsexual state.
Theoretically, there is no reason there could not be.
Lacking an explicit indication, my assumption is that FAITH likely assumed the hidden directives that Bob purged en route would ensure procreative activity, but they likely frowned on the idea of recreational sex (much less transsexualism), which is all that would be left without the biological component.
My guess is that FAITH simply edited out the sexual desire components while replicating Bob's psyche.
They seemed to have crude but effective control over components of the brain, and a complete lack concern for "irrelevant" portions.

**Let's talk about Omnistone**    So I tried out Omnistone and noticed a few quirks.
Right off the bat, here are the timings of when a keystone first appeared:  * First HoB was at 15mins  * First Predator was at 18mins - boots were already bought at 8mins * First Comet at 21mins * First Glacial at 23mins     For some reason Precision is very common with Omnistone.
Like it feels more like a bounce between Precision keystone vs the rest.
In my experience Aery, Comet, Glacial, HoB, and Predator are rare.
Seems most of the time it's Precision keystones, Aftershock, and Grasp.
Electro, DH, and Phase are somewhat in between.
I'm kind of curious to see what would happen if Spellbook was added.
Probably be OP or not, but it would make Omnistone more desirable.
Something that doesn't make it desirable are Fleet and Grasp keystones.
These are low impact runes.
I think if there was a gauge on impact level of keystones, these two would rank low due to their single use.
Something else about Omnistone is that the keystones do not tell you the stats or any information on them.
You don't know the damage on Electro, or the stats for Aftershock.
You're pretty much left in the dark.
This makes it hard to gauge how effective a keystone is, or what exactly it provides for the user.
Overall I see potential with this rune as being viable.
It lets users who want the runes in Inspiration without having to pick Glacial or Spellbook.
>People are allowed to stop actively enjoying something but, at the same time, see what's happened since they stopped.

Hopefully with news articles, and even the official site, quoting that these are full on new model reworks, people will quit saying that the new hero models are just a skin like what you got with the origins/legendary editions.
They are entirely new models that only OW2 owners can use.
All of your current skins will be updated to use the new models, and if you won't pay for OW2, you get the characters as we see them now.
And OW2 owners will most certainly have a graphics toggle to use the old/new models, for sure.

Democrats have prevailed in the Virginia legislative contest.
They will have control of both houses of the state legislature and the governorship -- the first time that has been the case since the modern Virginia Democratic party emerged in 1993.
That result will make possible a substantial progressive agenda, including background checks on guns and a minimum-wage increase.
As well, all four progressive prosecutors in Northern Virginia have won, and Democrats are taking nearly all other contests in that region (although the last Republican state legislator in NoVA may survive).
This result goes right down the ballot; all three Democratic-endorsed candidates for the Fairfax Soil and Water Conservation Board are also leading, as are those for the school board.

if he didn't say anything about JJ then fine  but as it looks right now it seems hard for JJ this year  more so cause we don't really know what's he packing.
all I've seen is him doing similar punches he did last year , if that's his gameplan then sorry, he isn't as strong as he thinks.
Logans punches will hit this year and they will hurt unlike last year.
although how I see it is if JJ can block well the first few rounds.
he'll explode Round 3 like last time  Either it'll be super disappointing like a 2 round loss for JJ or he'll win

It would make the price of everything else that *wasn't* automated seem to rise precipitously.
And agriculture was one of the very first things that we automated, and automated *hard*.

Question: What would've been the result if Markstrom had just blatantly pushed the net off its moorings as the Blues were coming down 3-on-0?
My understanding is that it's still just a minor penalty for delay of game.
That's probably preferable to letting the 3-on-0 continue.

Your list of examples sounds solidly Te-dom but doesn't really lean one way or another for Ni/Se or Si/Ne.
It could very well be the case that you're an ENTJ with an abnormal reliance on Ne processing, but I'd warn against dismissing ESTJ as a possibility too quickly.
I know you said you don't relate to ESTJ stereotypes but honestly?
That's not surprising.
Sensors get a shitty deal when it comes to our descriptions.
Contrary to what the tests and community may describe, it's not an inherent contradiction to be a forward-thinking SJ or a philosophical SP ‚Äî speaking from experience.
Where would you rank your Si preference?
Actual Si not the bullshit version that people always equate to conservatism or sentimentality.
Actual Si being your awareness of spatial and sensorial relationships.
It's the Goldilocks function.
"Too hot, too cold, just right".
It's the function in play when you can't pinpoint exactly what you're noticing/experiencing **but you can tell** that something is happening or happened or changing or already changed.
And that it warrants adjustments or closer scrutiny.
If you relate to that as much if not more than Ni's tendency to generalize literal sensory perceptions into narrower estimations then you know what's up.

I seem to recall a certain Eastern Conference team in this exact scenario a few years ago.
Lost a highly paid forward/SG and an all-star point guard, had a few young wings unexpectedly emerge, and took LeBron to 7 in the ECF.
They got penciled in as a Finals team with all their important guys coming back from injury, and things went to shit lol.

It was an ongoing process of seeing doctors and was discovered after a series of issues.
I have had random issues on and off with my health for ages, and I suddenly was ill in late November 2018 that eventually became extreme amounts of agony that took place December.
As result I had my gallbladder removed.
During that time I had a lot of bloodwork and scans and such done because my parents wanted to know what was wrong with me, and during the gallbladder fiasco, I was referred to an endocrinologist due to strange results in my bloodwork.
I did a couple more samples and a saliva test for them, but no evaluation (This was not long before the surgery so I was having issues just leaning over without feeling pain.)
and then after I got my gallbladder taken out.
They wanted to make sure that my bloodwork being off wasn't the result of my gallbladder being infected.
So they did a physical where they noted my appearance along with a hump on my back I've had since about two years ago and just assumed it was normal.
I was given more tests, three types over the course of a few weeks and the results were bizarre, and eventually I was given the diagnosis of cyclical Cushings.

In lower league, if you are skilled enough it doesnt even matter.
For Legendary League u will still have a few chances for GM for the season.
As a F2P, i always only had r4/r5 event heroes, yet i have been able to make gm for a couple of seasons already.
You get much less chances, but when your meta heroes are the best combination for that week, make it count.
This season, connie was the event, and she only gets used as much as the other support heroes.
Actually i dont remember a week where she is required yet.
So whaling does nothing this season so far.
I'm sorry, stupid person here... How do any of the replies relate to antinatalism?

You should be able to find all of this online.
Someone has already stated that if you can't find easy info like this online then you won't be able to survive in college.
Anyways, I'll put it here just cuz I'm bored: You can apply to any program stream since POST (Position of Studies) is not determined until you have 4.0 Credits, which is after first year.
Getting into comp sci POST is determined by 2 classes: CSC148 and CSC165/240 (Either is fine, but if you take both, they look at 240).
After looking at your competitive average and the rest of the application, you are either admitted or rejected from comp sci POST.
Since they merged the streams, the only advantage of being admitted for comp sci is that you have priority to enroll in these classes.
This means you will be guaranteed a spot in these classes, whereas others will be fighting for these spots (since a lot of people want to go comp sci or need comp sci for their program as well).
I am from a highschool that deflates grades, unlike some others that inflate grades.
I was 99 percentile in all of my standardized tests (SATs, APs, etc), but my average was low (like mid-high 80s) due to deflation.
Thus, I was unsure if I would be accepted to comp sci stream.
I applied for both comp sci stream and physical and mathematical sciences, and I got in for physical and mathematical sciences, but I was able to enroll in CSC148 and CSC165, which allows me to apply for comp sci next year.
TL;DR: You can apply for anything.
Just choose your campus.
However, if you apply for an easier stream just to get in, it means that you have a lower chance of enrolling into the classes needed to apply for comp sci POST.
However, it's not that hard to get in.
In your case, since you are provided 3 applications (I think), I would apply to Comp Sci, an easier stream to get in (like P&M Sciences), and then a third choice.
They will consider your 1st choice first, but if you get rejected you can still get in for P&M Sciences or whatever 2nd choice you chose and then take the comp sci classes needed to apply for comp sci major/specialist.
Note: all of this info is online.
An important part of college (and COMP SCI!) is being able to find the necessary information to answer your own questions, and for something like this you should really search it up online.

This is especially the case since you will eventually have to understand how UofT works better if you do decide to come here, so this info is not sufficient and you might as well read through all the info.
Also, an important part of comp sci is literally finding information about methods you did not learn about in class and applying them, so GL lol.

Eat foods that are rich in protein.
It tends to stave off hunger.
You can use a supplement or food sources like chicken, tofu, fish, lentils etc.
Use fattier foods for long term energy such as nuts , olive oil and fish.
Stay away from sugar as it spikes your insulin and will make you hungry again and crash.
Also avoid caffeine which can also make you hungry and stay hydrated do your metabolism is steady.
Excersize can also reduce the burden of counting calories cause you‚Äôre burning them.
Follow up your workout with protein to manage your cravings.
After a while you‚Äôll wonder where your hunger went.

This jumbled mess is a fully functional Diverging Diamond interchange with left facing ramps in a parclo loop configuration.
Why?
Because just to the left of the frame the highway splits in two and I keep my on and off ramps at least 65 units apart.
I call it the Kidney Diamond, and I use it elsewhere when I have two interchanges, one of which needs a high capacity, too close together for standard ramps.
As you can see, the interchange fully services two of my cities northermost arterials: Discordia St N and 43rd Ave N, as well as facilitating travel between 43rd and Discordia.
Additionally, a cargo line runs past and services the double track train station, and a monorail line spans the interchange as it moves from Discordia to 43rd.

Rapidfire controllers are common enough that it's noticeable.
Going up against someone with one is a bit frustrating, because rapid fire controllers:  Turn single fire weapons into fully automatic.
Which means you just hold the trigger and it shoots at its maximum rate of fire without effort on your part.
Hence turns flick shooting into a simple tracking shooting, which is an easier aiming technique.
Since the weapon is originally single fire, the recoil is drastically lower than an original automatic weapon, making it that much easier to control.
Every single fire gun turns into a hard hitting laser.
I don't know of any way devs can detect them with 100% certainty.
It not a God cheat, but it definitely gives a solid advantage over those who don't have it.

And I regularly pay for both of us or we split 50-50, whereas he has never paid for me (which is fine, I don't expect him to).
Richard Killmer says that the "p" stands for "play!" but you gotta hear him say it in his voice.

Another teacher said that piano is "forte at a distance."
Importantly, quiet does not mean weak.
Quiet is still strong; your tone still sings; the sound still projects to the person in the back row of the concert hall, but it does not carry the same presence or grandeur as a forte.
The Breathing Gym guys (mainly targeted for brass players, still very applicable to wind players) have an exercise with the following metaphors: bow and arrow for forte, darts for mezzo-forte, paper airplane for piano.
It's an interesting way of thinking about it.
They mime the motion of shooting/throwing/launching while practicing the exhale.
The paper airplane is much gentler than the bow and arrow but it is by no means limp or weak.
In young bands, it's to get stuck in a loop of trying to play quiet and it sounds ugly so you want to play quieter (or god forbid the director asks you to play more quietly to try to hide you) and this idea of trying to sound invisible is really really really not helpful at all for the development of a young oboe player.
Make that sound.
Sing!
A stage whisper is piano, but it's not quiet.
Practice to improve your dynamic range by playing long tones, doing a long sustained diminuendo and imagine that you are simultaneously increasing the intensity of the note while you are reducing the volume.
Diminuendo very slowly, imagining that the sound is slowly getting more distant but has not lost any of its strength.
When you find the point where the note cracks, stop just before reaching that point and hold it out.
Repeat, repeat, repeat.
Start on comfortable, forgiving notes so that you can build on success before extending the exercise onto challenging notes.
Your dynamic range will often be limited by your reed.
We can't help you much with that from here.

The accusations that were thrown out entirely were done so because it was turning into a circus, with basically anyone claiming to know Kavanaugh back in the day being able to send anonymous e-mails accusing him (or someone else, most of these people weren't sure it was even him they were talking about) of sexual misconduct.
Even if Christine Blasey Ford's testimony is true (This is the only semi-convincing one IMO since it contained specifics and was backed by a polygraph) the trial became such a dog and pony show because the prosecution was too quick to jump on any possibility without verifying it that it was hard to believe anything coming from them at this point.
And I don't even put much stock in that one because Ford didn't seem very sincere or believable to me, and a polygraph just means she believes she is telling the truth.
She easily could have been mistaken.
It was easy enough to see why Hell was the more desirable place than Heaven.
Ever since humans created the means to look into both Heaven and Hell and see what eternity held, Hell had been most people‚Äôs go to choice.
Once we got a glimpse, it was simple to understand why Hell was better.
It had everything that Heaven didn‚Äôt have which was A LOT!
Heaven was for the religious snobs, the ones who camped out on college campuses holding signs that read ‚ÄúJesus Saves‚Äù and slut shaming any woman that walked by not wearing a turtleneck and ankle length skirt.
Besides that, Heaven just looked boring.
Heaven there seemed to be only white marble buildings and fences, green parks with pristine trees, and fluffy white cloud back drops.
That was not what most people were interested in.
Looking into Hell was an entirely different story!
Hell was where all the famous rock stars and movie stars went.
Hell was filled with night clubs and what seemed to be beaches with bikini clad women and perfect sun year-round.
There were always parties and people lounging and stuffing themselves with the most amazing looking food and mini umbrella topped drinks.
Hell looked to be the most fun place to go and enjoy eternity.
That was why it was the biggest mistake of my short life.
When I kicked the bucket with my family all around me at the young age of 93, I of course chose Hell.
It had been years since I had enjoyed myself as much as those in Hell looked to be and I wanted some.
I should have known better.
That was Gods final test, would you choose sin upon eternity‚Äôs doorstep or would you stay the course and go with God, on the path of holiness?
I had been in hell more than 500 years now.
I had not been to one beach.
I had not drunk one margarita.
There had been no not clubs, hell there was no dancing at all.
It was nothing but manual labor, whippings, and never ending, unbearable heat.
My best day in Hell would never come close to my worst day of mortality.

Oh baby girl love has been the most painful aspect of my life so I can imagine, I hope I could give you answers but tbh last time I felt like my partner didn't loved me it was a very toxic relationship so I just broke up with him.
He gaslighted me the whole time and was very manipulative so I blocked him because I knew he would try to reach me.
I have a lot of "weaknesses" but I do have will power (I'm a vegetarian lol) so when I truly decided that we were over I meant it.
I've not had contact with him ever since.
I'm not over him, I do suffer, every day, but it was the right decision.
I know how it burns all over your body, how you feel this impulse to just arrive to wherever he is right now and just kiss him and tell him everything.
It's fucking hard and I can imagine how in pain you are baby girl and omg I just wish I had a magical poison for both of us.. but I guess we just need to survive it.

It's natural that my name and face, and my employers corporate branding becomes associated with broken equipment, even though were here to fix what the customer breaks.
I'm a quiet shy person.
Left to my own devices I can easily go my 3 weeks annual leave making no sound other than calling my cats at dinner time.
But in front of clients, I have to cultivate the friendly easy going, socially Alpha knight in shining armour, and vanquisher of all things resembling a problem.
I'm largely successful since word gets back to my superiors all the time and I'm frequently requested.
A number of our clients only want to deal with me, and I often hear things with my Vulcan Hearing:  "...is room 3 still down?
Jason's here so it should be fixed soon... if I wasn't married he'd be in so much trouble [giggling]"  I'm no Jody, guess that's why I'm single, it's always the hot married ones *facepalm*
I've approached someone who was reading ONE time (I'm a female and the gender of this person could've gone any which way, judging strictly by appearance).
The reason was that I was discussing with my friends what breed-mix their dog might have been, and I just had to ask.
When I approached them, I realized they were reading a book by an author that I LOVE.
We talked about the pup for a minute and then I recommended some more of that author's books.
I apologized for the intrusion because lord I know how annoying it is to be interrupted while reading.
They were super graceful about it.
I also recommend using a wider tip and just going fairly slow.
to get clean lines on the outside you could use a finer tip and then fill in the rest.
remember that just cranking up the heat will burn deeper but not necessarily darker than a few strokes on a lower setting.
> "bad" children's parents complain and get angry instead of teaching.
Agree.
Though I don't know if I was considered a bad or good child..
I generally follow them even as an adult, it's never "good" enough.
Or only wrongs are highlighted.
Sometimes I do what they say so I can blend in / disappear and Nmom doesn't have her full attention on me.
I agree, I just diagreed with his definition of fixing
No worries.
I use both zionclub and real debrid and absolutely love it.
Let me know if you have any other problems getting running, I‚Äôm happy to help.
I really do understand this kind of thinking.
I grew up in a really abusive home, I was picked on for being in special ed, then i got picked for not talking, then I got picked on for talking too much.
I'm 26, relatively good looking, athletic, a veteran.
For unknown reason, in ways I cannot describe it, ppl hate ppl for being secure, ppl will also hate you for being different.
A lot of the trauma I experienced in my life was trying to please people who could never love me.
Trying to shape my personality, my body, my comforts for them.
When it comes to love, the only person that really matters who loves you, is you.
The sad part is, most peoples love is conditional, even for urself  but the love u have for urself has to be the most important, and that's just the gods honest truth.
If you truly love urself, other peoples opinions of you have little if no effect on you and that shit will bother the fuck outta people (and its hilarous honestly)   You might just live the rest of ur life as an anomaly like myself, but you're still loved, just not in the ways you think, maybe not the ways you expected.
However, love yourself and always love urself, ur the only person guaranteed to be on ur side in life

I'm not going to answer on each point because /u/historicusXIII already did and I share his comments, but just on this as it wasn't addressed:  > they would also stab their partners in the Flemish government in the back.
How is it stabbing anyone in the back?
OVLD and CD&V aren't tied to N-VA for eternity.
Those are two different governments, at two different levels of power, working independently.
They are free to choose their coalition partners as they want.
This is the logical result of the State reforms, that have been made because of the Flemish nationalists' demands, by the way.
N-VA should welcome the fact that federal and regional powers work independently, as this is what they want.
During the last legislature, all 6 governments in Belgium had different coalitions.
This whole "backstabbing talk" is just N-VA desperately trying to be in a federal government.
Like when De Wever stopped the Flemish government formation for a month just to wait to see what happened in the federal negotiations.
That way, he could make sure to keep alive the threat of throwing OVLD or CD&V out of the Flemish government if they went with Paars Groen in the federal government.
But he couldn't wait indefinitely so now he lost that card.

Judging from his interactions with Michonne/Judith and Daryl/Lydia, Negan is more like the uncle that gives good advice but parents think is a bad influence.
Lydia apparently lives with Daryl and he takes care of he so he's pretty much taken up the role of father figure in her life but then again people can always have more than one father figure so it could work for both Daryl and Lydia and Negan and Lydia.
Cassady said she thinks Negan reminds Lydia a little of her father but back in the preview special for season 10 in July she said to look forward or whatever to more father/daughter bonding with Daryl and Lydia so it looks both Daryl and Negan are father figures to her.
I hear you all, and agree.
I am heart sick, OP, and wish you the best.
You must be completely anxiety ridden, yet what you are doing is the right thing.
I have a hard time, I think, when we say that dad loves us but he is sick.
Cause I don‚Äôt think love is being abusive.
What kind of words make more sense?
Love is caring and sacrificing and being there and being vulnerable and wrong sometimes, but never never manipulative or abusive.
That is not love.
That is control.
So I dunno - no real question here, just a comment that there must be a better way to talk about this!
Whether about it, to kids, or among survivors.
I am leaving an emotionally abusive relationship.
I just realized my STBX has all the signs of a covert narcissist.
Been dealing with his shit for a very long time.
I don‚Äôt think he truly loves me- I don‚Äôt care anymore.
I want peace.
But whatever it was, it was not love.
Any ideas re talking about these things?
I didn't mention AEW because WWEs videos are better.
I‚Äôm quiet people let me know I‚Äôm quiet but these same people never talk to me unless it‚Äôs to comment in a group setting how quiet I am just start talking to them ‚Äúhey do you watch blah blah?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo?

While I agree with you about D3 lifting the curtain of mystery, I don't think it's really D3's fault.
Most of the "curtain of mystery" had already been lifted long before D3 was even announced, through books like the Sin War trilogy.
Diablo had the mystery of a vague, barely-understood world with occult shadows creeping in.
You could argue (correctly IMO) that this was because the writers simply hadn't written the lore yet, but for a horror-themed game it doesn't matter whether the yawning, Lovecraftian abyss waiting behind the curtain was there due to design or due to lack of design: its existence was the important thing.
D2 expanded the scope of the Diablo universe a lot.
As you said, it's clearly a step away from its origins.
Instead of being a horror game set in the depths of an abandoned monastery, it's a globe-trotting adventure to stop the Lord of Hell from unleashing the end of the world.
The game's story was fairly bare-bones, so it didn't go into that much detail about the world of Sanctuary, but already there was a comparatively massive focus on backstory and lore compared to what went into D1.
And from there, the accompanying books expanded the story even further into an epic war between Heaven and Hell.
My point is that by the time D3 rolled around, there was enough story within the Diablo universe that I wouldn't really consider the lore mysterious or scary.
We understand who the Lords of Hell and the Angiris Council are through background lore, and most of the story threads are things that established fans already know about.
The Black Soulstone is really the only new thing.
From this perspective I think it's hard to really play the story up as mysterious or eldritch because the backstory has already been explained.
Sure you need to venture outside of the game to get it, but a simple wiki walk will expound the entire history of Sanctuary, as well as the characters of all of the major players in the story.
Because of this, I don't think it's really D3's fault that Sanctuary no longer feels mysterious.

>  I don't watch him live.
Might watch highlights here and there.
But it seems every day for the last couple of weeks, I've came here to see some sort of new drama associated with him or Misfits.
That right there is the main problem.
You casuals need to stop using 30s-1min "highlights" to criticize people.
Pretty much all these clips are made from the other side, who are 99% of the time angry kids white knighting their favorite streamer from any possible L situations.
Obviously it looks bad when you only see a few second clips out of the 10+ hour streams.
Need to stop looking at the highlights as if they're the answer, and figure out what the question was before you make final judgement.
I don't watch OTT, but I do know one thing for a fact.
He's having these problems with the same group that's been linked to this exact kind of drama on multiple occasions in the past.
Sometimes you gotta open the door and think maybe it's possible the smaller streamer is not at fault for once.
Or y'all can continue supporting the immortals and keep lynching smaller streamers from no pixel, the server already lost most of the quality anyway :P

If you got into another program, chances are if you perform well in your first you can transfer into the program you want (check your school).
Taking math/stats is probably a requirement for actuarial or finance, so taking that program will be more likely then that you have some pre-requisites for the courses you need to take if you switch programs (that is, it will be faster than taking something unrelated where the courses are unlikely to be a requirement of the program you want).
Same goes with comp sci and engineering: a strong math background is often a requirement for a good CS program.
So, if you got into math, take math.
Work your butt off in your first year then transfer into the program you want.
But your best bet is to talk to your advisor at the school you're going to.
First and foremost, if you‚Äôre at a college campus there might be conforms for cheap or free at the health and wellness center!
If not at college there is online retail where you can order and read without judgement, or sometimes sample packs of different sizes.
If you are male bodied the most important thing is actually the ‚Äògirth‚Äô measurement (circumference of penis) for condoms.
This is because too tight in the girth, condom can be unpleasantly tight.
Too loose and it‚Äôs easy to slip off.
Length is not as important, though you don‚Äôt want something too massively long where it‚Äôll be easy to slip off with friction (pretty sure there are sizing guides online for girth x length calculations for different brands)  Another thing: most condoms you‚Äôll want to buy are probably pre-lubricated with a little bit of water or silicone lube.
An extra bottle of lube is useful in case the condom isn‚Äôt lubricated or you need extra.
Spermicide is another thing you‚Äôll have to be careful with.
If you‚Äôre not with a committed partner, you might want spermicide and spermicide free in case anyone is allergic.
Package should say if it has spermicide (generally on interior of condom).
If you aren‚Äôt sure if you or a partner is allergic, spermicide free is pretty common!
TLDR: lots of online options where you can read up.
I‚Äôd start with a sampler and see what sizing works best for you or your partner.

This was funny a couple of times, but man is this meme getting over used and played out faster than usual.
On a serious note I'm a little worried about how fast its grown.
As a millennial, I get where this frustration comes from.
My parents always second guessed my choices growing up and even now and think they know best and are pretty traditional.
Yes, previous generations are overly opinionated, but sometimes they have valid points even if it annoys us.
I'm just worried that this is going to be the new buzzword/phare that will be used to shut down all critiscm and critique and prevent actual conversation and growth (like how the Left in America call everyone that disagrees with them Nazi/alt-right/sexist/racist and how the Right calls everyone a commie/libtard/cuck).
Im sure it'll be fine.
I just hope it stays as a joke and people dont start adopting it as an actual way of deflecting constructive or well meaning critiscm.
2019 should have Ardie at 6 and Cane at 7 as that's how they lined up for the majority of the year.

I'm going to transition to a longer eating window.
I eat a vegan WFPB diet and  I can't fit the amount of food I need into a one hour window.
It's just too much volume.
I TRY to do an hour but I'm still figuring it out.
I feel like I'm frantically eating.
I weigh all of my food/ingredients so I know I'm precise when I say sticking to one hour (when watching as fast as I can) leaves me anywhere between 600 and 900 calories.
So I think I'm going to stop worrying about the actual hour window and just eat one meal a day, no matter how long it takes.
Also lmao its been 2 whole months
Careful using benzos for tinnitus.
While it can help it, many people end up with it much worse after using benzos.
There were people who used it for a slight hum, and when it stopped working or started causing issues and they had to stop, that slight hum is now a roaring alarm, and this can continue for a long time after stopping.
(I was harmed by my klonopin I used long term and had extreme withdrawal from a low dose, so I was in the benzo recovery groups for quite a while.
Tinnitus was a huge issue for many stopping benzos, even those who didn't have it prior.
I would get mild tinnitus occasionally, just slightly annoying that only lasts a short period.
When I was coming off of benzos, I had times I didn't hear my alarm clock going off, or an ambulance driving, because the ringing in my ears was so loud I could not hear it.
BE careful using benzos for tinnitus since they affect the nervous system directly.

You're assuming wrong, with the minimum wage going up every year most cooks end up at minimum and if you get 15-18 an hour you won't be getting any raises once the minimum wage is at $15.
You're only way of making decent money cooking without working 2 jobs is to become a KM, sous or something besides a line cook.

A lot of fanfics I read have Nick and Judy start out in a relationship, (including my own) which is fine if you have a time jump from the start of the film to the beginning of your fanfiction .
I prefer the slow but realistic development of the relationship.
Like they start out friends, maybe one has feelings for the other or they both do, but don't want to admit it just yet.
Then one confesses feelings for the other, and start dating.

Yes honey, that is the price of exclusivity.
What's the problem with that?
You wanna have it right now?
Pay up more.
Otherwise wait for the next time until it becomes cheaper.
Paladins does the same shit, even worse.
Pay now or wait at least six months and pray to rng gods to get it once it gets put in a 300 crystals chest.
That's why you have aaaaall the time in the world to farm your credits beforehand if you're interested in an upcoming event and only buy your skins at the last day of it because there might be a chance you get that exact skin in dozens of lootboxes throughout the event.
If you don't care about skins, you don't have to farm credits.
If you care about them, you have a way of directly earning them without a gambling.
The only problem about this is in your head.
In what world are Paladins skins "constant free"?
You are playing to get battle pass experience which lets you unlock the very limited selection of skins they put in it, after you already pay for them.
The exact same way I can play the game which lets me get credits to buy ANY SKIN available in the store at that moment.
And that is for free, i don't have to pre-purchase anything to have that option, like you have to pay for your battle pass.
Yeah sure BliZz bAd GuY with its crappy and addicting methods.
Meanwhile every second player on Paladins plays Ruckus against the bots for the past 2 weeks by staring in the wall and expending gazillion ammo lol, give me a break.
Such a fun thing to to.
That is total freedom - praying their awfully rng/grindy quests will help finish your battle pass in time.
Of course Paladins needs to step up their game with skin production because that is literally the only thing they make money off.
Overwatch is not free and its major income comes from the esports scene, so the skins in it are less impressive because they are secondary thing and they can give more for free.
It's apples and oranges.
And Hirez devs are saints?
They shut down and shat publicly on guys who helped them improve the game by 200% and fixed 3 year old gamebreaking bugs by creating extremely detailed repro videos.

At the end of the day it's about who's the more competent dev and whose product is working better.
Playing the game because of its background and not because of the actual content and quality must be really sad, I kinda feel sorry for you.
There is an updating table on Github of all the companies involved with China and doing bad business, including Apple and Google.
Unless you flush your phones down the toilet and burn your Nike shoes or whatever the fuck you're wearing.
Being fine with everything else but boycotting Blizzard because of the hate bandwagon makes you nothing but a pathetic hypocrite.
Yes, Alexander Pistoletov, a legend!
Sounds way over complicated to me, I'd skip calisthenics and all those variations and focus on building a base on the 3 core lifts before adding in all those variations of shit.
No, not true.
Among other items, it works well because BCH does not have RBF; that is main reason it works on BCH and does not work on BTC.
BCH will have uncongested blocks And will always be, , ,  until BCH Tx load is 25-30x more than BTC today.
Plans are to scale well in advance of tx growth -> so nothing to ever worry about.
i think Fuentes could break in this season or next.

I would use whole herb oregano (or other strongly aromatic herbs like rosemary or thyme), simmered in cheap red wine, if I needed an antiseptic solution to wash scrapes and lacerations and could not get real medical supplies.
The tips of conifer branches also work. (back-country first aid level stuff)  But for hard surfaces in the home, laundry bleach in water is the standard lab disinfectant.

A pint of bleach per gallon of water.
Oh I know I was referencing an old saying lol I usually spend about hours every week thinking about my views and browsing Reddit thinking about politics.
If you can believe it I used to be a Christian right winger who disliked gay people until I was about 14 when we moved schools from a back water town to inner city.
I was debating a kid in class and just went wtf to my own views.
Since then I've just kinda been on a journey of change/discovery to figure out what I really believe vs what I was told to believe.
but yeah lol glad to be on the good side after a decade of uncertainty lol.
Got any anarcho-socalist reading recommendations?
Oh shut the fuck up.

Is it really "conjuring up money out of nowhere" or just manipulating Robinhood into giving users a totakly unjustified line of credit?
If I went to the bank, took out a $2000 loan, used that as collateral on a $4000 loan from the same bank, etc.
It isn't inventing money it's just tricking the bank into giving me theirs and the bank and their creditors are the ones at risk.
This shouldn't be a systemic issues unless RH is such a massive part of the financial system that it going under would have a cascading effect.

Use a few drops of Myrcene-  It opens up your CB1 and CB2 receptors.

I think the PI penalties need a complete overhaul.
A penalty should not be of such a high significance in a game.
Maybe make it like college so its just a 15 yarder

I have yet to watch a Tomino anime that doesn't do this.
None of them have a plot.
None of them have any kind of overarching structure.
They end up being a nearly unending chain of barely related events until it gets to the final battle and Tomino tries to narratively burn the place to the ground.
The movies at least mask the problem by compressing it.
It's still going to be full of characters without agency, that constantly are reacting to other people's dumb shit.

> Because until now, we haven‚Äôt had to let in men.
Lesbians have a disproportionately high abuse rate?
Women hit men all the time, the statistics are like 60/40 mentowoman womantoman.
Are you saying women cannot be abusers?
That is a pretty absurd take, even from a GC sub.
Letting in men is different from letting in abusers.
I used this metaphor before but its the same as citing crime statistics to show that we shouldn't let black people in cities as they are too violent.
The vast majority of people are not violent, just because one group is shown to be more than another still means that the odds of a single member of that group being violent is absurdly low and persecuting them based on that is unreasonable.
Why should people not be able to get out of vehicles lmao

I got accommodations through disability support services during undergrad for my depression.
Was able to turn in assignments late and miss class as needed.
I have not self disclosed after college.
Any job application I ever self disclosed on didn't result in an interview.
Possibly a coincidence.
But I also have medication that works now and have been in therapy for much longer, so it is easier to cope.
(Honestly kind of wish I could do college again now that I am more stable...I don't even remember most of it bc of depression.)

I prefer with akashi who i understand and looks cute - catgirl akashi always.
i really liked the "hybrid" approach they had in nazjatar, 3-4 quests that will guide you around the area and then you can choose to do the world quests that are on the way or in the same area as the quests
Yeah agreed, in the meantime I do different activities labelled like 'sub-category - activity' e.g. 'shower - night'

It‚Äôs actually more like the opposite because you can take pictures and not understand the material (the shoddy Krabby Patties made by Neptune) or you can make quality notes and understand everything (the amazing single Krabby Patty).
I assume kawhi has a chronic knee issue that will follow him for his entire career, thus making load managment a must for him specifically.

He's hardly been shocking.

It's only a matter of time until he regains his spot ahead of Lovren assuming no injuries.

They are an adult, yes, but as parents we must decide which choice we can live with and if we have gone far enough.

Honestly I agree, but I presume Riot's tested it and knows what people like.
If it matters that much, Kassadin, Fizz, Yi during ultimate, ghost summoner spell, and phantom dancer all let you move through minions.

So for what did Jesus died on cross?
his death is meaningless?
>I‚Äôm asserting your interpretation is pagan.
How do you explain the Old Testament and the New Testament passages which claims that Human soul is eternal?
the death of Christ makes zero sense if Human Soul isn't eternal and dies on Earth
Oh no! üò± Can we play again?

That is NOT the joke.
The joke is just as bad as that but that is not it.
Idk if you have ever poured milk over rice krispies before, but when you do they make a sound like that of fireworks (but really more like if there for 50 people around 2 inches tall each clapping), hence the slogan for Rice Krispies ‚Äúsnap, crackle, pop‚Äù

Actually, no? She clearly has no problem with him having pupils and hangs out with Ippo and them.
> mari confronted her and told that his retirement was something that she wanted and not ippo.
Mari?
The most biased woman in Ippo's life who is clearly only interested in boxer Ippo and doesn't care about him as a person nor his health? How would she even know what Ippo wants, she only talks boxing with him
> kumi \[...\] played a part in it
Where are you even getting this from? How little respect do you have for Ippo's agency that you think Kumi saying once or twice that she doesn't like him boxing would make him quit?
Your spelling errors ‚Äúfrusterate‚Äù me even more so.

Man.
I owned a Pixel 2 (regular) and that piece of hardware was the best damn device I ever owned.
The only other device I have truly enjoyed using as much was my first droid, the Xiaomi Redmi 2 Prime.
I don't know what went down after that but the aspects which made Pixel devices unique, namely the allure of using 'pure' Android on a device made by Google from 'ground up', together with a great smartphone photography experience, is no longer exclusive to the Pixel line.
Even OEMs such as OnePlus have beaten them, and offer comparable (if not absolutely similar) software, and camera, with arguably better hardware.
Nevermind the plethora of Android One devices available on the market today, offering a more or less same software experience, with the ability to use a ported Gcam .apk out of the box and take great pictures without breaking the bank, and you begin to see the problems with the newer Pixel phones.
P.S: I now use a BlackBerry Android device with a full-fledged capacitive keyboard, as my primary.
Picked up a Bronze Edition KeyOne for a very good price point and don't see myself going back to tapping on glass again.
In my experience, among certain management types there exists this absurd theory that IT is a pure cost center and that it's quite safe/acceptable for it to be one of the first things cut and one of the last things to receive a budget plus up.
They're often the same assholes who IT departments tend to mollycoddle (out of necessity often as not) in order to get even minor things accomplished so they rarely see how bad the rest of the company's infrastructure is.
I don‚Äôt know whether to be encouraged by decent play for most of the game and mostly good compete, or be horrified by our 30s to 8 min lapses that are costing us games.

Oh and, quick note about your point number 4 : in your mind, UoCing 2 units for the STMR in the current system is better than... UoCing 2 prisms in the... new system, is that right ?
Yeah it's true that using 20 UoCs over 16 UoCs for the exact same result seems like a way better choice, indeed.
The Ng5 two knights is not the fried liver attack.
The fried liver attack is specifically after Ng5 d5 exd5 Nxd5 Nxf7 which requires two incorrect moves to be made, Nxd5 (Na5 is correct) and Nxf7 itself (d4 is correct).
